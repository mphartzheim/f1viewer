## [v1.0.23] - 2025-04-04

### üêõ Fixed
- Linux build now correctly installs required OpenGL and X11 development headers (`libgl1-mesa-dev`, `xorg-dev`, and `pkg-config`), resolving Fyne and go-gl compilation issues.

### üß∞ Internal
- Updated `release.yml` to enable CGO and install Linux dependencies before building.

---

## [v1.0.22] - 2025-04-04

### üêõ Fixed
- macOS build now correctly enables CGO and uses the system SDK to support OpenGL dependencies (fixes build failure with `go-gl/gl`).
- Restored macOS compatibility for Fyne-based UI builds.

### üß∞ Internal
- Adjusted `release.yml` to use native builds for macOS instead of cross-compiling.

---

## [v1.0.21] - 2025-04-04

### ‚ú® Added
- Native Linux packaging: `.deb` and `.rpm` builds are now generated automatically using FPM.
- Checksums are now included for all release archives.

### üî• Removed
- AppImage builds. We‚Äôre sorry. You didn‚Äôt want them. We didn‚Äôt need them. They‚Äôre gone. (For now.)

### üß∞ Internal
- Updated `release.yml` to support multiplatform packaging and cleaned up legacy logic.

---

## [v1.0.15] - 2025-04-04

### Fixed
- Corrected build failure due to missing `CMakeLists.txt` in AppImageKit root

- Fully functional AppImage generation with no FUSE or squashfs errors remaining

---

## [v1.0.14] - 2025-04-04

### Fixed
- Replaced AppImageTool binary with source-built version to avoid hardcoded FUSE/mksquashfs path issues
- Eliminated `/usr/local/bin/../lib/appimagekit/mksquashfs` error by fully controlling the toolchain

---

## [v1.0.13] - 2025-04-04

### Fixed
- Resolved `mksquashfs` not found error during Linux AppImage build
- Added `squashfs-tools` to GitHub Actions runner to provide `mksquashfs`
- Explicitly exported `MKSQUASHFS` environment variable so `appimagetool` could locate it
- Finalized fully working AppImage pipeline for Linux releases

---

## [v1.0.12] - 2025-04-04

### Fixed
- Installed `squashfs-tools` to support AppImage packaging via `mksquashfs`

---

## [v1.0.11] - 2025-04-04

### Fixed
- Corrected AppImage packaging by extracting the proper `appimagetool` binary from the AppImage archive
